        <h2 class="m-4">Welcome to Rich Little Excise Tax Consulting</h2>
      </div>

      <p class="lead m-4">
        Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night from a dream that started out as:
        Hello this is the IRS (or insert your favorite state agency) and I want to talk to you about (check
        one of the following:
      </p>
        
      <ul class="m-4">
        <li>You filed for the federal ethanol blenders credit for all 10 of your ethanol production
        plants for three years, but you failed to obtain a Form 637 registration letter as an ethanol
        producer. We are allowing your credit but assessing you $10,000 per plant and $1,000 per
        day for your failure to timely register. The total penalty assessment for the 10 entities is
        $10,950.000.</li>

        <li>We have records that show that you were operating a taxable fuel terminal that was not
        properly registered for 3 years and we want to assess you over $1 million in penalties for
        failure to register and also $360,000 for failing to file the required IRS Form 720 TO
        returns.</li>
        
        <li>From the filed IRS Form 720 TO returns by various terminal operators you are shown as
        the position holder on over one million gallons of gasoline and we do not show any record
        of you filing a Form 720 Quarterly Excise Tax Return. Thus we are assessing you
        $184,000 tax plus failure to file, failure to pay and failure to deposit penalties.</li>

        <li>Our State of X records show that you did not have any diesel fuel activity in our state for
        the month of January. Our records do show gasoline activity however. Since you did not
        have any diesel purchases, or sales we have revoked your license and notified your
        suppliers that they are now required to bill you the tax on all future fuel purchases until
        you are re-licensed with us.</li>

        <li>We are looking at your biodiesel claims for $1 million and we are denying the claim since
        you used the wrong form.</li>

        <li>We are looking at your fourth quarter claim for $1 million and it appears that the
        transactions did not fully occur in December, but were finalized in January after the
        ethanol fuel credit has expired. We are denying the credit in full and assessing you the
        excessive claims penalty of $2 million.</li>
      </ul>
        
      <p>
        While the above examples may seem far fetched they are taken from actual cases and are meant to
        illustrate the importance of obtaining competent advice from a proven excise tax expert. Get the proper
        assistance before you make the “deal” and don’t wait for that phone call from the IRS or state authority.
        FYI the IRS will never make the initial contact with you by telephone.
        We are here to help, and if we can’t we can refer you to someone who can help.
      </p>
