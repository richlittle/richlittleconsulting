        Richard has over 45 years of experience dealing with motor fuel excise tax related issues.  After 5 years associated with the Houston Deloitte excise tax practice as a senior manager he retired from there in May 2018.  After encouragement from several associates, and many of his former clients he has decided to continue assisting clients with their excise tax matters as an independent consultant. While at Deloitte Richard specialized in research and consulting for federal, state, and local excise taxes. Richard was called upon in the most difficult audit defense and assessment resolution cases.  His years at the IRS provide clients with an insider view and understanding of how the system works and helped clients manage expectations and eliminate unnecessary delays and conflicts.

        Prior to joining Deloitte Richard began his career with the Internal Revenue Service as a field agent and conducted audits covering all sizes of taxpayers including some of the world’s largest integrated oil companies. Richard spent eight years as a cooperating agent working with the IRS Criminal Investigation Division in the investigation of organized crimes involving federal motor fuel taxes. While working in an undercover joint task force with the FBI, IRS, CABOE, and the Los Angeles Police Department he was given the code name “The Professor” because of his extensive knowledge of motor fuel excise taxes, how to run a fuel business, and his contacts with the industry.  After testifying in over twenty cases as either an expert, or summary witness, he moved to the IRS Washington National Office where he finished his career as the Fuel Excise Tax Senior Policy Manager.  In this position he was responsible for developing and managing all national fuel excise tax policy decisions.  In this position Richard was also the IRS Excise Tax liaison with the petroleum industry, state taxing authorities, and visiting foreign tax officials interested in knowing about Federal excise taxes.
